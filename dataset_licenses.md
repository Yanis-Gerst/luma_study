# Licenses of used datasets

Unfortunately, we failed to find an explicit license for the CIFAR-10/100 datasets, hence, we did not include the images in our dataset repository, and instead, allow the users to download them directly using the provided LUMA dataset compilation and uncertainty generation tool.
